Google Wallet is a mobile payment system that acts as a virtual wallet, allowing users to make payments and transfer money straight from their phones. The service is free for users and can store credit, debit, gift and loyalty card information. Available to anyone with a newer Android or Apple smartphone, Google Wallet gives users another fast way to make payments at ecommerce stores that accept it.

## How Google Wallet Works

Google Wallet is what is known as a server-side wallet, which means that all of a user's information is stored remotely on Google's system, rather than on the user's device. Transactions take place between Google's servers and the merchant's existing payment processor.

It acts somewhat like a gift card: users place a set amount of money into the wallet they can then spend as desired. As far as the user's bank is concerned, the transaction is identical to any other debit or credit, only the transactions go exclusively through Google rather than the merchant's point of sale. Assuming the merchant's point of sale is configured to accept Google Wallet, transactions work the same as any other accepted payment method.

While support for the mobile app is still sketchy, Google Wallet offers a physical card as well that can be used anyplace that accepts debit MasterCard.

## How does Google Wallet stack up to other options?

Google Wallet's main competitor is Apple, although other companies such as Samsung and PayPal have their own digital payment systems as well (Samsung Pay and PayPal Wallet, respectively). While the products may have a few differences when it comes to the user, they offer similar features from the perspective of an online store owner. Both want to make it as easy as possible to facilitate transactions.

* Neither charge fees.
* Liability rules are the same as regular card transactions.
* Both can support rewards programs.
* Both make the purchasing process much faster.
* Both utilize NFC (near field communications) for in-store purchases.
